Define Identifiers And Datatypes?
IDENTIFIERS :

An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, 
variables, etc. It helps to differentiate one entity from another.
Rules for identifiers:
* Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) 
or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore _. Names 
like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.
*  An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, 
but variable1 is perfectly fine. 
* Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
* We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. in our identifier.
* Identifier can be of any length.


DATATYPES : 

Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. Data types 
represent a kind of value which determines what operations can be performed on 
that data. Numeric, non-numeric and Boolean (true/false) data are the most used 
data types. However, each programming language has its own classification largely 
reflecting its programming philosophy.
* Int #we use it for number
* Char # we use it for only single alphabet
* Str #we use it for name and any collect of alphabet
* Float #we use it for number in decimal
* Complex #we use it for number in ai+j form
* Double #we use it for number and char Inc. the size 
* Long #we use it for number and char also it creates whole block and also Inc. the size
* Short #we use it for number
* Unsigned #we use it for number
* Signed, etc #we use it for number.
