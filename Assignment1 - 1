Distinguish between variables,constants and literals with examples?
VARIABLES :
variable is a name which is used to refer memory location.
variable is known as Identifier and used to hold the value.
In python we don't need to specify the type of variable because
variable is a Type infer language. Variable names can be a group of 
both letters and digits, but they have to begin with a letter or 
underscore. It is recommended to use lowercase letters for variable name.
Example: Var="kavya"
         print(var)
CONSTANTS : 
A Constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.
It is helpful to think of constants as containers that hold information 
which cannot be changed later.In Python, constants are usually declared and 
assigned in a module. Here, the module is a new file containing variables, 
functions, etc which is imported to the main file. Inside the module, constants
are written in all capital letters and underscores separating the words.
Example : PI=3.14
          GRAVITY = 9.8
LITERALS : 
Literal is a raw data given in a variable or constant. In Python, 
there are various types of literals :-
Numeric literals : Numeric Literals are immutable (unchangeable). Numeric 
literals can belong to 3 different numerical types Integer, Float and Complex.
Example: a = 0b1010 #Binary Literals
         b = 100 #Decimal Literal
         c = 0o310 #Octal Literal
         d = 0x12c #Hexadecimal Literal
         #Float Literal
         float_1 = 10.5
         float_2 = 1.5e2
         #Complex Literal
         x = 3.14j
         print(a, b, c, d)
         print(float_1, float_2)
         print(x, x.imag, x.real)
String Literal : A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. 
We can use both single, double or triple quotes for a string. And, a character 
literal is a single character surrounded by single or double quotes.
Example : strings = "This is Python"
          char = "K"
          multiline_str = """python was Introduced by Guido van Rossum."""
          unicode = u"\u00dcnic\u00f6de"
          raw_str = r"raw \n string"
          print(strings)
          print(char)
          print(multiline_str)
          print(unicode)
          print(raw_str)
Boolean Literal : A Boolean literal can have any of the two values: True or False.
Example : x = (1 == True)
          y = (1 == False)
